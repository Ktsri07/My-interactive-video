# My-interactive-video
This is my first interactive video. This video is done with the help of a software called Lumi which is used to keep interaction questions in the video and use simple techniques in powerpoint presentations. This type of interacting video is helpful for the students for self-assessment.
My team members who worked along with me are :
1. A. Nikhita.
2. A. Pujitha.
3. M.Akhila
4. K. Sandeepa
